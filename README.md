## Brief Introduction

I am a faculty member at School of Management and International Institute of Finance, USTC. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2013 from the Department of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Fugee Tsung. Back in 2009, I received my B.E. degree from the School of Mechnical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of Prof. Zhibin Jiang. 

I work on the operation and business strategies related to inventory, pricing, contract design and consumer behavior, trying to figure out the optimal rules. To apply the strategies, I frequently use convex optimization and dynamic programming to develop efficient algorithms. I am also interested in multiple areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, etc.
